## Tech Used

Python, Django, postgresql, Grid, bootstrap

## Next Steps

- I'm still working on refining user auth, I started experimenting with django guardian and need to work on that a little more to protect the Edit and Delete routes so only the users who create a post can edit or delete their posts.

- In a future version I'd also like to implment React to refine the front end and update the design. 

- I'd also like to grow the database to include previous wolf packs and individual wolf information.
