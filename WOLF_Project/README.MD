## Wolf Conservation Project

- This app is meant to be a resource for anyone interested in learning more about wolf conservation, the current wolves of Yellowstone National Park, and a place to share their own experiences.   This site will have infortaion on the the benefits wolves have on their ecosystems and environment, as well as information on the the packs and pack member of the  Current Yellowstone wolf packs.  Additionally users who create logins will have be able to share their own experiences with others by writing about their story and posting photographs. 

##  Project Plan

- I will use Django to build a front and backend, I will cite existing sites and resources to build my own database.  Users will be able to share their stories but will have to submit a contact form to make any amendments to the database, those changes will need to be executed by a site adminitstrator.
